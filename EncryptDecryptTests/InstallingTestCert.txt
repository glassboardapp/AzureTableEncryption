Installing Table Encryption certs is a lot like installing SSL certs. In fact, there's only one extra step. 

1) Start -> Run, type in "MMC"
2) File -> Add/Remove Snap-Ins
3) Choose the "Certificates" snap-in. Click Add
4) In the popup, choose "Local Machine"
5) Right click the "Personal" store, choose "All Tasks -> Import"
6) Go through the import process for the cert (EncryptDecryptTests\AzureTableEncryptTestCert.pfx)
  6a) The password is "test"
  6b) You need to import the private key. You might as well make the cert exportable.
8) Find the cert you just imported, it will be named "AzureTableEncrypt Unit Test". Right Click -> All Tasks -> Manage Private Key
9) Make sure to add yourself and the built-in "Network Service" user. Make sure you have Full Control, and NetworkService has Read access.

That's pretty much it.
